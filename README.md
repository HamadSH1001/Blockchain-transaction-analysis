# Blockchain Transaction Analysis

A project for analyzing blockchain transactions to evaluate the efficiency, security, and scalability of various blockchain platforms. The analysis involves using Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse transaction data and visualizing the results in a tree structure.

## Features

- Extract transaction data from blockchain platforms
- Clean and preprocess data
- Use DFS to traverse transaction data
- Visualize transaction data in a tree structure
- Identify security issues and vulnerabilities
- Evaluate scalability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-transaction-analysis.git
    cd blockchain-transaction-analysis
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Place your transaction data in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the analysis script:
    ```sh
    python analyze_transactions.py
    ```
3. View the results in the `output/` directory.
